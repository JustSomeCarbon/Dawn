# Solace
~~I will probably change the name of the language as I find something better, but I am really bad at naming things.~~
An implementation of a new language. This language is for fun and is an exercise.

## About the language
The plan for the language is to make Solace a simple functional programming language. The plan is to take some of
the interesting and useful features from C, Rust, Elixir, and other langauges to preserve them while ignoring and changing
any unnecessary features for this language. The plan is to keep it simple.
This will be a large project requiring a lot of hours, and since I am fairly busy
I will be updating it when I have the time.
Specifications will be updated and implemented as I am able to do so.

## Grammar & Syntax
Detailed grammar and syntax for this language will be described in the langSpec directory.
