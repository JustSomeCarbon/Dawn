# DayLang
I will probably change the name of the language as I find something better, but I am really bad at naming things.
An implementation of a new language. This language is for fun and is an exercise.

## About the language
The plan for the language is to make Sol a simple Object Oriented programming language. The plan is to take some of
the interesting and useful features from Java and C++ and preserve them while ignoring and changing
the other less likable features. This will be a large project requiring a lot of hours, and since I am fairly busy
I will be updating it when I have the time.
I will be adding more specifications as I have time to write them down.

## Grammar & Syntax
Detailed grammar and syntax for this language will be described in the gram_syn.txt file
located within the misc directory.
