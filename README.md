# DayLang
I will probably change the name of the language as I find something better, but I am really bad at naming things.
An implementation of a new language. This language is for fun and is an exercise.

## About the language
The plan for the language is to make Sol a simple functional language. I will be adding more
specifications as I have time to write them down.

## Grammar & Syntax
The grammar and syntax for this language will be described in the gram_syn.txt file
located within the misc directory.
