# Solace
~~I will probably change the name of the language as I find something better, but I am really bad at naming things.~~
Solace is a simple functional programming language developed as a hobby project. Solace is
designed to be simple to read and write with. As the language is implemented, more
information will become available.

## About the language
Solace is a compiled language developed with the C language, utilizing Flex and Bison.
The plan is to keep it simple. Solace is statically typed.
The language is in its infancy stages and as such does not have much information available,
however the specification list for Solace can be found in the langSpec/spec-file directory. 
Specifications will be updated and implemented as the language grows.

## Grammar & Syntax
Detailed grammar and syntax for this language will be described in the langSpec/spec-file
directory. Solace utilizes a C like syntax where brackets {} are utilized in defining
blocks of code. Solace is statically typed and as such all variable types must be
listed upon definition.
Effort is being put into making the grammar and syntax of Solace as simple and easy to
understand as possible.
